# Rules for Derivatives Continued

.center[.bold[Product Rule]]

$$
\large
\frac{d}{dx}=[f(x)*g(x)]=f(x)g'(x)+g(x)f'(x)
$$

Breakdown multiplication into two separate functions

Then keep the first times the derivative of the second and add the derivative of the first times the derivative of the second

---

# Product Rule Example

$$
\begin{align}
y&=2x(x^2+3x) \\
y&=\overbrace{2x}^{f(x)}\overbrace{(x^2+3x)}^{g(x)} &\text{Break into two functions} \\
\frac{dy}{dx}&=\overbrace{2x}^{f(x)}\overbrace{(2x+3)}^{g'(x)}+\overbrace{2}^{f'(x)}\overbrace{(x^2+3x)}^{g(x)} &\text{Apply Power Rule} \\
\frac{dy}{dx}&=6x^2+12x  &\text{Algebra clean up}
\end{align}
$$

---

# Rules for Derivatives

.center[.bold[Quotient Rule]]

$$
\large
\frac{d}{dx}\left [\frac{f(x)}{g(x)}\right]=\frac{g(x)f'(x)-f(x)g'(x)}{[g(x)]^2}
$$

Same idea as product rule, but order matters

The denominator has to be $g(x)$

---

# Quotient Rule Example

$$
\small
\begin{align}
y&=\frac{x^2}{(x+1)} \\
y&=\frac{\overbrace{x^2}^{f(x)}}{\underbrace{(x+1)}_{g(x)}} &\text{Identify function}\\
\frac{dy}{dx}&=\frac{\overbrace{(x+1)}^{g(x)}\overbrace{2x}^{f'(x)}-\overbrace{x^2}^{f(x)}\overbrace{(1)}^{g'(x)}}{\underbrace{(x+1)^2}_{[g(x)]^2}} &\text{Quotient Rule} \\
\frac{dy}{dx}&=\frac{x^2+2x}{(x+1)^2}
\end{align}
$$

.bold[Note:] Algebraically solving Quotient Rules can be very challenging. Try to reduce it down to a useable form.

---

# Rules of Derivatives continued

.center[.bold[Chain Rule]]

$$
\large
\frac{d}{dx}[f(g(x))]=f'(g(x))g'(x)
$$

Take the derivative of the outermost function then multiply by the derivative of the innermost

Probably the most important rule for advanced calculus

---

# Chain Rule Example

Use a trick called u-substituion

Label the inner function as u

Take the derivative with respect to u

$$
\begin{align}
y&=(x^3-2)^2\\
g(x)&=u=x^3-2 &f(x)=u^2 \\
\frac{d}{dx}(x^3-2)&=\frac{dy}{du}\cdot\frac{du}{dx}=\frac{d}{du}(u^2)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}(x^3-2)
\end{align}
$$
---

# Chain Rule Example Continued

$$
\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dx}(x^3-2)&=\frac{d}{du}(u^2)\cdot\frac{d}{dx}(x^3-2)\\
\frac{d}{du}(u^2)=&2u  &\text{First Term}\\
\frac{d}{dx}(x^3-2)&=3x^2 &\text{Second term}\\
\frac{dy}{dx}&=2u\cdot3x^2 &\text{Total Solution} \\
\frac{dy}{dx}&=2(x^3-2)(3x^2)  &\text{Sub } u=x^3-2\text{ back in}
\end{align}
$$

# Application of derivatives allows us to find crucial information to solve environmental problems

1) Find instantaneous rate of change at any point

2) Find when functions are increasing or decreasing

3) Find the Optimal values of functions

    - Optimal values are key to designing effective policies

# How quickly is the human population rising right now?

Dochy et al. (1995) used the following function to describe the increase in human population over time:

$$
x(t)=\frac{1}{c-\beta t}
$$

Where $c=9.833*10^{-3}$, $\beta=4.849*10^{-6}$, and $x$ is the total human population in millions at year $t$.

How quickly was the human population increasing in 1450?

How fast does this model predict human growth rate should be today in 2023?

First think of which rules we would for $x(t)=\frac{1}{c-\beta t}$

# Derivatives help understand the behavior of functions

Useful in designing predictive theory for new policies

Personal Example: Will a fishery insurance program incentivize overfishing?

$$
\begin{align}
\begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial K}{\partial \gamma} \\ \frac{\partial L}{\partial \gamma}\end{bmatrix}
=-\begin{bmatrix}
\frac{\partial U}{\partial K \partial K} & \frac{\partial U}{\partial K \partial L} \\
\frac{\partial U}{\partial L \partial K} & \frac{\partial U}{\partial L \partial L}\end{bmatrix}^{-1}\begin{bmatrix}\frac{\partial U}{\partial K \partial \gamma}\\ \frac{\partial U}{\partial L \partial \gamma}\end{bmatrix}
\end{align}
$$

# Let's start a little simpler

.bold[Definition of increasing and decreasing Intervals of a Function]

- For the function f (differentiable on the interval $(a,b)$)

    - If $f'(x)>0$ for all x values between a and b, this interval is increasing
    
    - If $f'(x)<0$ for all x values betwen a and b, this interval is said to be decreasing
    
    - If $f'(x)=0$ for all values between a and b, then the function is constant within the interval

# Optimization problems find relative extremum (aka max or min) of functions

1) Find First Order Conditions:

- Relative extremum exist at all points on function where $f'(x)=0$

2) Verify Second Order Conditions:

- Whether an extremum is a maximum or minimum requires us to test if it is increasing or decreasing at the extremum

- $f(x^*)$ is a local maximum if $f''(x)<0$

- $f(x^*)$ is a local minimum if $f''(x)>0$

# Graphical Example

$f(x)=x^3-12x+2$

# Solve analytically

First Order Conditions:

$$
\begin{align}
f(x)&=x^3-12x+2 \\
f'(x)&=3x^2-12 \\
x^*&=-2  & x^*=-2
\end{align}
$$

Second Order Conditions:

$$
\begin{align}
f''(x)&=6x \\
f''(-2)&<0  &f''(2)>0
\end{align}
$$

By the first order conditions we know that $x=2$ and $x=-2$ are local optimum.

The second order conditions inform us that $x=-2$ is a local maximum and $x=2$ is a local minimum.

3) Your team has been hired to help the city of Santa Barbara to help eliminate a nasty pollutant in our streams. You are choosing between two policies. Policy A provides $\sqrt{10x+4}$ benefits where $x$ is the dollar spent on interventions. Policy B provides $\sqrt{20x+4}$ benefits for every dollar spent. However, each policy has a cost associated with each. Policy A has a constant linear cost at $2x$ and Policy B has a constant linear cost at $3x$.

1) Find the optimal amount of interventions dollars to spend for each policy. Consider both costs and benefits. [hint: Remember $\sqrt{}$ is just $x^{\frac{1}{2}}$. You can use exponent rules to help solve]

2) Which policy provides the most benefits?

3) Which policy is cheaper?

4) Which policy should the city of Santa Barbara pursue?
