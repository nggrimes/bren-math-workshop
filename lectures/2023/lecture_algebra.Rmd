# Workshop Objectives

```{r,echo=FALSE,fig.align='center',out.width="30%"}
knitr::include_graphics("img/confused.gif")
```

1. Shake off the math/schoolwork dust

2. Equip students with the math skills to succeed in all Bren Courses

3. Learn how valuable math is to environmental science

4. Build collaborative environment crucial at Bren

# We will be using Team-based learning 

- Science and policy are done collaboratively

- TBL shows better learning outcomes than traditional lecturing

  - [In Math](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10511970.2018.1542417?casa_token=We71OsRHNuQAAAAA:U4I567tQynbXcFHplLpIkkamtpfUf1GqCgIKBP453cVdHJ8b3mP-yymXkVNOc4JJ4aZfJxpGvU766Q)
  
  - [For Women especially](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00220485.2017.1397571?casa_token=d394sBXFFSEAAAAA:Sa68G6KKjBzxy6aD9KBnRH7W5xChBl_PYfy-Yeck2YlOCoDOxp903xu_6S9yTpFTwqVtugWK23im2Q)
  
  - [Higher engagement](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/pdf/10.1187/cbe.17-03-0055)
  
- We'll be doing a TBL Lite*, because I know orientation week is busy and school hasn't officially started

  - Keep extra pre-class work and assessments to a minimum

## Math is an important tool in Environmental Science

.pull-left[
.center[.bold[Math to investigate]]

Math is science's foundation for finding evidence

Math verifies positive statements 
  - (C02 concentrations increase by X amount for every Y amount of electricity used)
]

.pull-right[
.center[.bold[Math to communicate]]

Can only communicate what you understand

Policy people need to know how to support their arguments

Weaknesses in methods can be identified by understanding the mathematical foundation studies are built on

# Algebra Review

# Rules of Algebra

1. Never change an equation, we rewrite into more useful forms

2. Manipulate BOTH sides of an equation with the SAME THING

3. Order of Operations (aka PEDMAS)

# Fundamental Theorem of Alegebra helps us solve for unknowns

Often times we look for solutions when equations equal zero

Interesting properties at zero or the difference between two equations

Comes from calculus maximization problems (covered in day 3)

# You were already finding zeroes!

This is just a 1st degree polynomial. How many solutions did it have?

3x+2=10x-12

Finding nth degree polynomials zeros are harder

Focus on 2nd degree polynomials

Second degree polynomials can be written as a multiplication of their "roots" aka solutions

### Multiply each term in the adjacent polynomial and add together

\begin{align*}
\text{First}&=x*x & \text{Outside}&=3x & \text{Inside}&=-4x & \text{Last}&=-12 \\
x^2-&x-12=0 & &\text{Add all terms together}
\end{align*}
$$

# What do I mean by roots or solutions?


What happens if x=4 or x=-3 in $(x-4)(x+3)$

--

Try the same thing with $x^2-x-12$

--

The only way to get $x^2-x-12=0$ is for x to either be 4 or -3

--

4 and -3 are said the be the roots of the equation

1) Identify which numbers you should plug into which variable of the quadratic formula (e.g. a,b,c)

4x^2+x-14=0

2) Identify which numbers you should plug into which variable of the quadratic formula (e.g. a,b,c)

3) What happens if $b^2-4ac$ is negative?

4) Expand $(3x-6)(2x+1)$

# Team Assessment

---
class: small

You're team measured the concentrations of pesticides in a lake exposed to agricultural runoff. The intern in charge of finishing the calculations ran off for the weekend leaving you all to finish their work. They left behind the following equation describing the total amount of pesticides in the lake if runoff is stopped from the farm by a new policy incentive reducing pesticides use:

$$
\begin{aligned}
&y=(8-2t)(t+2) \\
&\text{Where } y \text{ is pesticde concentration in ppb} \\
&\text{and } t \text{ is time in years}
\end{aligned}
$$

.small[Work with your team to discuss conceptually how you would solve the following tasks.

1) Write out the intern's work in a more useful equation

2) How long will it take for the pesticide concentration in the lake to reach zero? Since the equation is a polynomial describe why one solution is more applicable than the other.

3) Present your findings (Choose between a graph or table)

4) What is the average change in concentration from year 0 to year 4?

5) Explain to your client why concentrations might behave the way they were modeled.

# Solutions

## 1) Solution

Let's FOIL out the equation so it becomes easier to graph.

$$
\begin{aligned}
y&=(-2t+8)(t+2) \\
y&=\overbrace{-2t^2}^{\text{First}}-\overbrace{4t}^{\text{Outside}}+\overbrace{8t}^{\text{Inside}}+\overbrace{16}^{\text{Last}}\\
y&=-2t^2+4t+16
\end{aligned}
$$
---

## 2) Solution

Two possible ways to answer:

.pull-left[.center[Use the Quadratic Formula]

$$
\begin{aligned}
0&=-2t^2+4t+16 \\
0&=\frac{-4\pm\sqrt{4^2-4(-2)(16)}}{2(-2)}\\
0&=\frac{-4\pm\sqrt{16+128}}{-4} \\
&t=4\text{, } t=-2
\end{aligned}
$$

.pull-right[
.center[Use the factors]
$$
\begin{aligned}
