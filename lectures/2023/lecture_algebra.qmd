## Workshop Objectives

![](img/confused.gif){fig-align="center"}

1. Shake off the math/schoolwork dust

2. Equip students with the math skills to succeed in all Bren Courses

3. Learn how valuable math is to environmental science

4. Build collaborative environment crucial at Bren

## We will be using Team-based learning 

- Science and policy are done collaboratively

- TBL shows better learning outcomes than traditional lecturing

  - [In Math](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/10511970.2018.1542417?casa_token=We71OsRHNuQAAAAA:U4I567tQynbXcFHplLpIkkamtpfUf1GqCgIKBP453cVdHJ8b3mP-yymXkVNOc4JJ4aZfJxpGvU766Q)
  
  - [For Women especially](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/pdf/10.1080/00220485.2017.1397571?casa_token=d394sBXFFSEAAAAA:Sa68G6KKjBzxy6aD9KBnRH7W5xChBl_PYfy-Yeck2YlOCoDOxp903xu_6S9yTpFTwqVtugWK23im2Q)
  
  - [Higher engagement](https://www.lifescied.org/doi/pdf/10.1187/cbe.17-03-0055)
  
- We'll be doing a TBL Lite*, because I know orientation week is busy and school hasn't officially started

  - Keep extra pre-class work and assessments to a minimum
  
## Team formation

Live coding demonstration

::: aside
Basically I'm using a constrained k-means algorithm to group everyone into equally balanced groups then pulling randomly from each to create balanced groups based on the likert scale responses of the survey. Full explanation will be included in a write up to see how code works

## Team expectations

Support and encourage each other

Communicate between all group members

Describe to your team what is the purpose of environmental science?

How would you go about solving environmental problems?

## Algebra {background-color="blue" .center}

## Uses of Algebra

- Describe and manipulate models

- Solve for unknowns

- 

## Rules of Algebra

1. Never change an equation, we rewrite into more useful forms

2. Manipulate BOTH sides of an equation with the SAME THING

3. Order of Operations (aka PEDMAS)
